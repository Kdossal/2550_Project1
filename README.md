# PHP 2550: Practical Data Analysis - Project 1

## Smoke Exposure & Children's Behavioral Outcomes
This project delves deep into understanding the ramifications of Smoke Exposure during Pregnancy (SDP) and Environmental Tobacco Smoke (ETS) on children's behavioral outcomes. A collaboration with Dr. Lauren Micalizzi from the Department of Behavioral and Social Sciences, this research sheds light on a pertinent public health issue.

## Background
Exposure to smoking during pregnancy (SDP) and environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) are among the most hazardous exposures a child can face.

- 7-15% of infants are exposed to SDP annually.
- Over 25% of children encounter household ETS.
- The economic toll of SDP amounts to a staggering $4 billion every year in health-care costs.

Such early smoke exposure elevates the risk of:

- Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder.
- Substance use problems.
- Self-regulation problems (maintaining physiological, emotional, behavioral, and cognitive control).

## Research Objective
The primary goal of this research is to study the correlation between SDP & ETS exposure and:

- Self-regulation
- Externalizing behavior
- Substance use

## Study Design
A group of women were initially chosen from a study geared towards smoke avoidance intervention. The aim was to mitigate low-income women’s smoking and ETS exposure during pregnancy, and the children’s exposure to ETS postpartum.

- Total women in the initial study: 738
- Adolescents and their mothers chosen for this study: 100 (randomly selected)

Participants and researchers can access the baseline data. Additionally, there are two longitudinal follow-up assessments planned at 6- and 12-months post-baseline.

## Project Goals
The dataset you will be working on is aligned with the first of the three primary study aims:

AIM 1: Investigate the impact of SDP/ETS on adolescents regarding self-regulation, substance use, and externalizing behavior.

AIM 2: Uncover connections between self-regulation at baseline and substance & externalizing at the 6- and 12-month follow-ups.

AIM 3: Recognize self-regulation challenges that bridge the connection between SDP/ETS exposure and the degree of, and variation in, substance use (SU) and externalizing (EXT) severity over time.
